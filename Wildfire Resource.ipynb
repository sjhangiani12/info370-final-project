    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent media coverage seems to echo the nation's growing concern over the impact of wildland fires. Cumulatively, the top 10 fires in California have set aflame to millions of acres and damages thousands of structures.<sup>1</sup> Depending on their location, some of the larger California wildland fires have claimed the lives of dozens. In mid-November of 2018, the _Camp Fire_ in northern California killed 85 people.<sup>2,6</sup> The alarming death tolls alone provide enough reason to attempt to predict the potential impact of wildland fires. Environmental and economic damages are also a concern for homeowners, residents, insurers, governments, and nearby communities. For these reasons, it is no surprise that efforts to predict the behavior and effects of wildfires have already been made.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2016 report by the U.S. Fire Administration shows a general decrease in fire-related death trend.<sup>3</sup> This could be attributed to advancements in predictive and preventative technology, medical technology and techniques, or safer construction regulations/guidelines. However, previous attempts at predicting the behavior of wildfires have suffered from a lack of funding. This means that the practical applications of the models described in some literature are lacking.<sup>4</sup> Additionally, much of this research (and it's associated models) pre-dates the scientific research showing that \"wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons.\" â€” In fact, wildfire activity in the Western United States forests is thought to have increased in recent decades due to \"increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.\"<sup>5</sup> \n",
    "\n",
    "_The devastating and unpredictable nature of wildfires puts the lives of thousands of homeowners, firefighters, respondents, at risk._\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to better predict the size of wildfires in California. Due to the changing climate, the problems caused by wildfires in the western United States and California specifically are more pertinent than ever.<sup>5</sup> Accurate prediction models will allow communities to evacuate individuals and families at the appropriate time and place. This project limits the scope of the models to California wildfires, but the features used by the model are not specific the region. These models and techniques could be applied to any geographical locations that experience wildfires, assuming similar data is attainable. Models or technologies that provide accurate information regarding where and when to deploy containment efforts will have the potential to save hundreds, if not thousands, of lives.\n",

    "## Exploring the Data\n",
    "The data we would primarily be working with contains records of 1.88 Million US Wildfires. This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015. It is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. We would also be collecting associated weather data in order to relate causes of wildfires to environmental variables."

    "## Technical Models\n",
    "K-nearest neighbours is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In this case, we would be using knn regression to find an outcome (fire size) that is the average of the values of its k-nearest neighbours. The input in a knn model consists of k closest training examples in the feature space. We would also be using feature scaling - a useful technique can be used to assign weight to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones."
